# HexaneNetworks-designed Pterodactyl Themes
Themes for making your pterodactyl instance with a HexaneNetworks design.

## Can I use this theme?
Sure! These themes are open source and allowed for all modifications. However, I do not provide any support for anything non-Hexane related.

## How to use the install?
Each Theme has a small code snippet that you must run inside the Pterodactyl panel directory, this is normally located at `/var/www/html/pterodactyl/` The implementation command will take a backup of your current panel incase anything goes wrong during the theme change! So you dont need to worry about losing anything you already made!
